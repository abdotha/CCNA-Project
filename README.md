# CCNA Project: Advanced Network Implementation in Cisco Packet Tracer

## Project Overview

This project is part of my CCNA certification journey, where I designed and implemented an advanced network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer. The project showcases various essential networking concepts and techniques, demonstrating my skills and knowledge in network engineering.

## Features

- **VLAN Implementation**
  - Created multiple VLANs to segment network traffic for enhanced security and performance.

- **OSPF Dynamic Routing**
  - Configured OSPF to enable dynamic routing between different network segments, ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission.

- **Subnetting**
  - Implemented subnetting to optimize IP address allocation and network management.

- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**
  - Set up ACLs to control and filter network traffic, enhancing security by allowing or denying specific traffic based on defined rules.

- **Remote SSH Access**
  - Enabled SSH access on all routers and switches for secure remote management and configuration.

- **Network Address Translation (NAT) with PAT**
  - Configured PAT (Port Address Translation) on the ISP router to allow multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address, facilitating internet access.

- **Router on a Stack**
  - Implemented router stacking to connect different VLANs, providing a scalable and resilient network infrastructure.

- **Port Security**
  - Applied port security on switch ports to restrict access to the network, allowing only authorized devices to connect and preventing unauthorized access.
